Arrival operations at airports form part of a substantial benefit pool.\n  **WHY IMPORTANT** Little attention is currently given to the underlying mechanism of changing weather phenomena on arriving air traffic.\n  **APPROACH** This paper presents the conceptual approach to describe arrival management sequencing as a spatio-temporal problem within 200NM around an airport. The success of the trajectory-based operations will be analysed in light of significant weather disruptions at the arrival airports and within the studied arrival horizon.\n  **EXPERIMENT**\n  **MAJOR RESULT/TAKE AWAY**\n---\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThis article is work in progress.
