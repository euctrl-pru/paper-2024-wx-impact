abstract: |
  **TEASER** With air transportation recovering around the globe, the policy focus shifts back to environmental protection and the climate change impact of air transportation. Arrival operations at airports form part of a substantial benefit pool.
  **WHY IMPORTANT** Little attention is currently given to the underlying mechanism of changing weather phenomena on arriving air traffic.
  **APPROACH** This paper presents the conceptual approach to describe arrival management sequencing as a spatio-temporal problem within 200NM around an airport. The success of the trajectory-based operations will be analysed in light of significant weather disruptions at the arrival airports and within the studied arrival horizon.
  **EXPERIMENT**
  **MAJOR RESULT/TAKE AWAY**
